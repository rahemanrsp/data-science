Approach and Methodology

This project followed a structured data science workflow to build a machine learning model for predicting loan approval. The methodology included multiple stages, from understanding the problem to model evaluation and interpretation.

 1. Problem Definition

The project began by identifying the objective: to predict whether a loan application would be approved based on applicant details such as age, income, credit score, dependents, and home ownership. Since the outcome variable has two possible categories (approved or not approved), the problem was defined as a binary classification task.

2. Data Understanding

The dataset was explored to understand the structure, features, and target variable. Basic operations such as viewing the dataset, checking data types, and analyzing summary statistics were performed to gain familiarity with the data.

 3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The dataset was checked for missing values and duplicates to ensure data quality. Since the dataset was already clean, minimal preprocessing was required. Numerical features were scaled using standardization techniques to improve model performance. The dataset was then divided into independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target).

 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted using visualization tools to identify patterns and relationships among variables. Graphs such as histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps were created to understand data distributions and feature importance. This step helped in identifying which factors influenced loan approval decisions.

 5. Model Building

The dataset was split into training and testing sets using an 80:20 ratio. Logistic Regression was selected as the primary classification model due to its simplicity and effectiveness for binary classification. A Decision Tree model was also implemented to compare performance.

 6. Model Evaluation

The trained models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix was also used to assess prediction performance. Cross-validation was applied to ensure that the model produced consistent results across different data samples.

7. Interpretation of Results

Feature importance analysis was conducted to understand which variables had the most influence on loan approval predictions. Insights derived from this analysis helped in understanding real-world financial decision-making factors.

 8. Conclusion

The final model demonstrated strong predictive performance and provided meaningful insights into loan approval patterns. The methodology ensured a systematic and reliable approach to solving the problem.
